# Succeed in job interviews
## Why do I need to prepare for the job interview?
- Every person will be ever unemployed maybe once, maybe more than three times...
- There are no second chances to create a good first impression.
## What is a selection process?
The selection process refers to the steps involved in choosing people who have the right qualifications to fill a current or future job opening.<br><br>

### Modern Interviews with new ways to select talent.
- Google Code Jam is an international programming competition organized and administered by Google. The competition is a means to identify the best engineering talent for potential employment at Google.
- DHL, does a resume screening and puts their candidates to play classic games like Mario Bross, to see how they solve the problems presented to them.

### Types of interviews you may face.
- By stage.
- By structure:
1. **Panel**, usually two or three people, the human resources person and the project leader, each one asks questions about what they are interested in knowing about the candidate.
2. **Group**, usually two candidates are asked to answer the same questions that the direct manager asks them. Be very creative.
3.	**Competency based**, you will be asked about your past professional experience.

> "The best way to predict how a person will behave in the future is to know how they did in the past."


## What are professional competencies?

- **Knowledge is everything you know**; what you learned in school, what you learned on your own. Check them and compare them with the knowledge that is being asked for.
- **Experience**, what you've learned through practice may be from past work, or something you've done independently. Everything that is related to the vacancy you are applying for.
- **Skills** allow you to stand out as a professional and demonstrate your specific knowledge. That is, you are good at something without having to practice a lot.
- **Values**, the universal principles by which a person is governed, the ones you bring from home or family.
- **Attitude**, it is the behavior or the way of being in a situation, how do we face situations? It can be positive or negative.
