# Succeed in job interviews
## Why do I need to prepare for the job interview?
- Every person will ever be unemployed maybe once, maybe more than three times...
- There are no second chances to create a good first impression.
## What is a selection process?
The selection process refers to the steps involved in choosing people who have the right qualifications to fill a current or future job opening.<br><br>

### Modern Interviews with new ways to select talent.
- Google Code Jam is an international programming competition organized and managed by  Google. Competition is like a means to identify the best engineering talent for a potential job at  Google.
- DHL does a resume screening and puts their candidates to play classic games like Mario Bross, to see how they solve the problems presented to them.

### Types of interviews you may face.
- By stage.
- By structure:
1. **Panel**, usually two or three people, the human resources person and the project leader, each one asks questions about what they are interested in knowing about the candidate.
2. **Group**, usually two candidates are asked to answer the same questions that the direct manager asks them. Be very creative.
3.	**Competency based**, you will be asked about your past professional experience.

> "The best way to predict how a person will behave in the future is to know how they did in the past."


## What are professional competencies?

- **Knowledge is everything you know**; what you learned in school, what you learned on your own. Check them and compare them with the knowledge that is being asked for.
- **Experience**, what you've learned through practice may be from past work, or something you've done independently. Everything that is related to the vacancy you are applying for.
- **Skills** allow you to stand out as a professional and demonstrate your specific knowledge. That is, you are good at something without having to practice a lot.
- **Values**, the universal principles by which a person is governed, the ones you bring from home or family.
- **Attitude**, it is the behavior or the way of being in a situation, how do we face situations? It can be positive or negative.

### Sample question to evaluate INITIATIVE AND AUTONOMY:
- Tell me an example of a project or idea that you have carried out despite the limitations or oppositions of some co-workers. What is evaluated is the initiative, if there was no support from your colleagues or boss and you focused on solving that problem.
- Tell me something that nobody asked you to do at the time and that you now regret. Be very careful with this type of questions and talk as much as you can about your experience.Try to put your answer in the positive, even if the recruiter wants you to speak badly.
- Tell me about the last time you disagreed with a decision made by your boss. Communicate it in a light-hearted way:
"I never disagreed with my boss because he had more knowledge of the activities, I would propose different ways of doing things and he would tell me that, at another time, for example..."
Always communicate in a positive way and being honest

## Goals and Objectives
Goals and objectives are a fundamental part of knowing your professional profile.
### What are objectives?
Objectives are short and measurable steps that will help you reach the end.
- **Example:** you want to be a web developer, that is your goal, but to achieve it you must take some courses on the subject, these are your objectives that will help you achieve your goal.


**Note:** the short term plans are the objectives and how you see yourself in five years professionally is the goal.
