# Succeed in job interviews
## Why do I need to prepare for the job interview?
- Every person will ever be unemployed maybe once, maybe more than three times...
- There are no second chances to create a good first impression.
## What is a selection process?
The selection process refers to the steps involved in choosing people who have the right qualifications to fill a current or future job opening.<br><br>

### Modern Interviews with new ways to select talent.
- Google Code Jam is an international programming competition organized and managed by  Google. Competition is like a means to identify the best engineering talent for a potential job at  Google.
- DHL does a resume screening and puts their candidates to play classic games like Mario Bross, to see how they solve the problems presented to them.

### Types of interviews you may face.
- By stage.
- By structure:
1. **Panel**, usually two or three people, the human resources person and the project leader, each one asks questions about what they are interested in knowing about the candidate.
2. **Group**, usually two candidates are asked to answer the same questions that the direct manager asks them. Be very creative.
3.	**Competency based**, you will be asked about your past professional experience.

> "The best way to predict how a person will behave in the future is to know how they did in the past."


## What are professional competencies?

- **Knowledge is everything you know**; what you learned in school, what you learned on your own. Check them and compare them with the knowledge that is being asked for.
- **Experience**, what you've learned through practice may be from past work, or something you've done independently. Everything that is related to the vacancy you are applying for.
- **Skills** allow you to stand out as a professional and demonstrate your specific knowledge. That is, you are good at something without having to practice a lot.
- **Values**, the universal principles by which a person is governed, the ones you bring from home or family.
- **Attitude**, it is the behavior or the way of being in a situation, how do we face situations? It can be positive or negative.

### Sample question to evaluate INITIATIVE AND AUTONOMY:
- Tell me an example of a project or idea that you have carried out despite the limitations or oppositions of some co-workers. What is evaluated is the initiative, if there was no support from your colleagues or boss and you focused on solving that problem.
- Tell me something that nobody asked you to do at the time and that you now regret. Be very careful with this type of questions and talk as much as you can about your experience.Try to put your answer in the positive, even if the recruiter wants you to speak badly.
- Tell me about the last time you disagreed with a decision made by your boss. Communicate it in a light-hearted way:
"I never disagreed with my boss because he had more knowledge of the activities, I would propose different ways of doing things and he would tell me that, at another time, for example..."
Always communicate in a positive way and being honest

## Goals and Objectives
Goals and objectives are a fundamental part of knowing your professional profile.
### What are objectives?
Objectives are short and measurable steps that will help you reach the end.
- **Example:** you want to be a web developer, that is your goal, but to achieve it you must take some courses on the subject, these are your objectives that will help you achieve your goal.


**Note:** the short term plans are the objectives and how you see yourself in five years professionally is the goal.

## Soft skills
- **Soft skills** Are those attributes or characteristics of a person that allow him/her to interact with others effectively. Creativity being the main one according to the study "The future of work" of the World Economic Forum.

### Soft skills to start working life:
- **Creativity** To solve problems you must be creative, since there will be times when you do not have a process or protocol to follow, so show your creativity to solve problems and provide solutions, better ways to do or create something.
- **Adaptability** We are in a world of constant changes, new technologies, new versions of those technologies, software, etc ... And in interpersonal relationships you can face changes of bosses, projects, workplace, etc ... Adapting to it and not just accepting it will help you not to drag with the past and make room for the new. 
- **Flexibility**  We all want to work with flexible collaborators who in a situation think about the How if! Contemplating only what you have athand. That is, focus on what needs to be done to reach the solution or meet the goal. 
- **Collaboration or teamwork** You will be part of a work team, which in turn will have a relationship with other areas of work, so to increase your skills in this skill I recommend that you start learning about effective communication. 
- **Self-taught** Really being in constant learning, it was said before that this was only for professions such as doctors or scientists, but nowadays all professions complement each other and evolve.


### When you have people in charge:
- **Management of work teams** This can be a soft and hard skill because it requires active listening, empathy and good communication, but there are also different methodologies that can help you with this task such as the Belbin methodology or Management 3.0
- **Critical Thinking**  For yourself and your collaborators, this will help you in focusing and not losing the objective that is to give results and evaluate how you can improve something. 
- **Time management**  To define priorities and give delivery times, this will avoid many headaches. 
- **Effective communication**  This skill becomes increasingly important, since we will always be communicating our ideas, results, proposals, etc... it is important to use the right words with the right audience.



### In charge of an area:
- **Leadership** There are different styles of leadership, but one of what I consider most successful currently, is participatory and democratic leadership, this leader takes into account the opinion of his team, listens to opinions and ideas, but knows that he/she is responsible for the final decision. Listening to other points of view gives you loyalty and commitment from your team. 
- **Strategic vision**  At this point it is important that you see beyond, that is; that you are aware of the aspects that may impact your area, your business, your company, your country; unfavorably and favorably to foresee good opportunities or possible crises. 
- **Judgment and decision-making**  Consider the relative costs and benefits of potential actions to choose the most appropriate. 
- **Negotiation**  Once you have managed to communicate successfully you will now need to persuade and reach agreements. 
- **Cognitive flexibility**  It is the next level of flexibility, it is the ability to generate or use different sets of rules to combine or group things in different ways. 
- **Emotional intelligence**  Self-awareness and self-regulation are the key words of this ability. You will need them when you have great responsibilities and constant decision-making, developing emotional intelligence will help you reduce stress and manage your emotions in the best way.
